Psr2-code-generator is a library to generate PHP code programmatically, via a nice fluent api.
This library is a light version of the awesome https://github.com/gossi/php-code-generator, refactored to generate PSR-2 code.

Differences and restrictions from the original library:
- php 7.2+ strictly typed
- generate PSR-2 code **ONLY**
- generate only php 7.1+ code (strict types)
- no reflection nor reverse engeneering
