This library is a fork of the awesome https://github.com/gossi/php-code-generator, refactored to generate PSR-2 code.

When https://github.com/gossi/php-code-generator/issues/23 will be solved and the original library will support PSR-2,
this one will be superseded. 

## Installation

```
composer require cristianoc72/psr2-code-generator
